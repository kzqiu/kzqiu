### Hey, I'm Kevin! It's great to meet you! ^_^

I'm currently a student working mostly on my own projects as I try to learn more about computer science and electrical engineering. 

I really enjoy exploring a large range of different projects, especially ones that teach me how things work as well as new skills. Recently, I've been interested in:
- Programming languages
- Data science + machine learning
- Computer graphics
- High-performance computing

Please reach out for anything at all!
